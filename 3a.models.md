# AI initials models

- Linear regression: A statistical technique that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

- Logistic regression: A statistical technique that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables in binary classification problems.

- Decision trees: A simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks.

- Naive Bayes: A probabilistic machine learning algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem, used for classification tasks.

- K-means clustering: An unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is used to partition a dataset into K clusters based on their similarities.

- Random Forest: A popular ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the model.

- Support Vector Machines (SVMs): A popular supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks.

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): A family of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks, used for a variety of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
